    "As a shiver runs down my back, I realize that the A/C in here is cranked up way too high. I read somewhere that casinos pump in extra oxygen to keep their patrons alert and playing."

    "A quick scan of the heads lined up in front of monitors offers me a few potential Stunts amidst the sea of scrubs. By Accel’s description, he’s young and has bleached hair."
    "I’m able to narrow it down quickly and find the Stunt with a look at his computer screen. He’s in the middle of ladder match."
    "… And he’s playing StarCraft with one hand. The other is wrapped around a water bottle from which he takes an occasional drink from. "
    "He’s winning with some kind of early rush build. And by the look on his face, it’s easy to see that he takes great pleasure in that fact."
    "His opponent sends a salty one liner before dropping out of the game without a ‘gg’. Stunt grins wide and puts his hands behind his head, satisfied. "
    "After checking the post-game stats he glances over his shoulder to see me watching, and then spins in his chair to regard me."

    "He doesn’t seem convinced. I can hardly blame him."

    "I step outside and suck in a deep breath, relieved. The afternoon air is sweet and feels good in my lungs, and the early fall sunshine warms my skin from cafe’s air conditioned chill."

    "There’s a certain feeling you get when you know you’re going to lose a game. Most try to ignore it at first, as if the inevitable is just another challenge to fight through. Like your past mistakes don’t count if you just try a little bit harder."

    "Then, there’s the realization that you can’t win. That you’re about to have to queue up for another ladder game. That he may type ‘get out’ if you stay in the game any longer. That you just flew across the world for nothing."

    "I haven’t met many players that take losing in stride. It’s painful. A mark on your permanent record that says you were worse than someone else. A demonstrable statistic that you are lesser."

    "I sit at the PC with a blank look in my eye, mindlessly scrolling through posts and comments. Clicks shoot from my mouse like machine gun fire. A tweet mentions my defeat in passing, but no one acknowledges it."

    "I still haven’t accepted my loss. Though I wasn’t even particularly deep into the qualifier, going out 2-0 to a guy I’ve beaten on ladder before is beyond aggravating. My rage eventually fades, leaving me only with a sense of guilt. I should have practiced harder."

    "My miserable trance shatters as I become aware that the next round has begun. I handle my keyboard and mouse with less care than usual, stuffing it deep into my backpack with considerable clatter."

    "When I stand, a wave of relief washes over me when I turn to see that no one had been watching my game. Most of the people in the room are playing, the few that aren’t are crowded behind popular players or are filming the matches from behind. Videos with player APM are still popular, I guess."

    "I think about sticking around to watch more games, but the knot in my stomach persuades me to avoid anymore stress." 
    "People are nice enough to a foreigner with the heart to attempt a Code A qualifier, but without a win I’m just another in a long line of losers. "

    a "It takes some determination to come out here alone, no one is going to deny that. We’ll see if that determination translates to skill, eh?"

    "My joke nets a bit of laughter from the two, easing me from an astonished observer to a participant in a dream scenario. This isn’t going to be easy."
    "It’s not long before the next round of the tournament is set to begin. The bracket will probably take another few hours to work through, and a PC Bang with the bustle of a tournament probably isn’t the best training environment."
